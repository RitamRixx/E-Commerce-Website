                <h2>Statement Furniture: what is it?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are struck with this question then let us first tell you that it’s a piece of furniture which is perfectly matched with the place, colour and space of particular area of room. Statement furniture acts as eye catcher whenever you enter that place. That piece of furniture always catches attention by its look weather you want to give it or not and that’s the essence of it. For instance, it can be a brown and round wooden table with carvings on it lying at the edge of room just close to red colored wall with a sophisticated painting. Just that image is enough to make you feel the grace of it, isn’t it?
                </p>
                <h2>How to create your own statement furniture with wood?</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s not like you have to buy each and every thing to create statement furniture with wood. The best part is wood can be recycled and reused. If you have something already made of wood, you can renovate it or convert it into another piece, if possible. You can even try the wood finish paints to create a statement piece. For instance, if you have an old wooden chair, you can either polish it and place it where it best suits with the tone of room or you can convert it into a smaller but more attractive chair. In the same manner, you can smartly choose minimal dining table design to complete your unique style statement of furniture.
                </p>
                <h2>Why should you choose it?</h2>
                <p>
                    Who else doesn’t like attention? Yeah, every one of us strives to have it and surely you want your home to be attractive too. If you are on this side then choosing wooden furniture is your way out. Moreover, not just it provides a nicer look but is durable and environmental friendly. Keeping wood furniture gives an antique look your home.
                </p>
                <h2>Oak or Pine. Are you confused?</h2>
                <p>
                    Are you confused whether to choose Oak or pine wood furniture? Well, to make correct choice, you must know about their nature. Both oak and pine wood are used to make furniture and both are graceful. Although, oak wood is more costly than pine wood. Pine wood is light weight and oak wood is heavy which makes furniture made of oak wood heavy. Buying oak wood furniture would be more like an investment. In our view, choosing pine wood will be a feasible and ideal option.
